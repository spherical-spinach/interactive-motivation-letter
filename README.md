# Interactive motivation letter

The purpose of this project was to be a motivation letter for a summer job. The job was about a research studying information security and dark patterns, and how common users make decisions interacting with dark patterns in UI design.

The website is a UI mockup made with PencilUI. The idea is to demonstrate how dark patterns can be implemented in a UI design, guiding and pushing user's attention.

The site works best on a bigger screen rather than on mobile.
